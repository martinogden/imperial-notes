{\Large\bfseries\sffamily{Syllabus}}

\textit{This course continues and extends the techniques introduced in M1M1, with further differential equations and partial differentiation. There are brief introductions to difference equations, curve fitting and scaling, together with a variety of applications of integration.}

\begin{itemize}
\item First and second order differential equations.
\item Homogeneous and inhomogeneous linear differential equations.
\item Systems of linear differential equations – matrix solution.
\item Phase plane analysis: Qualitative analysis of solutions of differential equations and stability.
\item Bifurcation of first order non-linear differential equations.
\item Partial differentiation: Definitions, implicit partial differentiation, total differential, change of variables.
\item Functions of two variables: Taylor’s theorem, stationary pointe and their classification, contours.
\item Vector calculus: Definitions and physical meaning of grad, div, curl.
\item Applications of partial differentiation: Optimisation and Lagrange multipliers.
\item Applications of integration – area under curves, arc length, surface area and volume of revolution; double integrals – geometry, mass, moments of inertia; simple triple integrals.
\end{itemize}
